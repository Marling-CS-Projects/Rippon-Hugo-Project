| Graphics effects                   | ShellShock Live contains image effects such as bloom. These features are unnecessary for my project as I will be focusing on the gameplay aspects more. |
| Abundance of weapons and abilities | To keep the game simple and easy to pick up, I will be limiting the number of weapons and abilities                                                     |

### Overview

Checkers is a 2-player strategy board game where each player has 8 pieces which can move diagonally and take the opponent's pieces by jumping over them. It is a game known by everyone which can be played at all ages and still be enjoyed. There are many websites where you can play the game online with random people or your friends.&#x20;

### Easy to pick up

Checkers is a simple game that is known by most people today. The design only needs very basic models and the graphics are primitive meaning anyone can run the game on their computer. The game takes time to master however, meaning people will spend time playing the game to improve.

| Profiles            | Storing personal data or passwords on a database means that data breaches are possible and logging in takes time, removing from the pick up and play aspects I am hoping to achieve |
| Customizable themes | There will only be one theme used for my game and adding multiple would take too much time to design                                                                                |

| Colours  | In my game I will include many bright colours to enhance the visuals and attract the players' eyes to the screen.                                                                                                                                   |
| Skill    | Brawlhalla is an addicting game which anyone can play but requires skill to improve and therefore adds an element of mastery which provides satisfaction to the player when they see themself improve. I want to have a similar feeling in my game. |

| Platforming style               | My game is going to have no jumping or platforming in the mechanics                                                                                               |
| Multiple characters and weapons | Implementing multiple characters or weapons may take too much time to be convenient towards developing my project so only one weapon will be included in my game. |
