| Graphics effects                   | ShellShock Live contains image effects such as bloom. These features are unnecessary for my project as I will be focusing on the gameplay aspects more. |
| Abundance of weapons and abilities | To keep the game simple and easy to pick up, I will be limiting the number of weapons and abilities                                                     |

| Profiles            | Storing personal data or passwords on a database means that data breaches are possible and logging in takes time, removing from the pick up and play aspects I am hoping to achieve |
| Customizable themes | There will only be one theme used for my game and adding multiple would take too much time to design                                                                                |
