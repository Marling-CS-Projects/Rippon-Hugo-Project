### Age Ratings

There are many rating systems which classify the target audience for a video game used today. The most popular and commonly used age classification system is [PEGI](https://pegi.info/). There are also others such as [ESRB](https://esrb.org/), [bbfc](https://bbfc.co.uk/), and [USK](https://usk.de/).

All of these rating systems feature similar categories. There is usually one class for everyone/very young children, one for slightly older children, one for young teens, one for older teenagers and one for adults. This classes are clear and help stakeholders such as the consumer or consumers' parents identify if the game is suitable for them.
