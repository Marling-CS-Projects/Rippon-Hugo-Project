# 1.2 Stakeholders

### Age Ratings

There are many rating systems which classify the target audience for a video game used today. The most popular and commonly used age classification system is [PEGI](https://pegi.info/). There are also others such as [ESRB](https://esrb.org/), [bbfc](https://bbfc.co.uk/), and [USK](https://usk.de/).

All of these rating systems feature similar categories. There is usually one class for everyone/very young children, one for slightly older children, one for young teens, one for older teenagers and one for adults. This classes are clear and help stakeholders such as the consumer or consumers' parents identify if the game is suitable for them.

The game I will be making is targeted towards all players, so the PEGI rating I am aiming for is a PEGI 3. The criteria for a game to be rated PEGI 3 has been extracted from the PEGI official website:

> The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. No bad language should be heard.

There will be no explicit violence in my game. Comic explosions will be present but the game will still fall into the PEGI 3 category.
