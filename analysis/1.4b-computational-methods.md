# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly involves removing unnecessary elements from a problem to solve a problem. This leaves you with only the relevant information to the problem.&#x20;

## Thinking Ahead

The process of determining what the key steps of solving a problem will be and what subroutines, variables, classes will be needed for the program.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Breaking down a large problem into a set of smaller problems, which can be solved easier by humans.

## Thinking Logically

Identifying where decisions need to be made such as convenience or efficiency, determining logical conditions which will affect the outcome of a decision and determining how decisions affect the flow of a program.

## Thinking Concurrently
