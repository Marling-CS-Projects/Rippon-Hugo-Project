## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly involves removing unnecessary elements from a problem to solve a problem. This leaves you with only the relevant information to the problem.&#x20;

## Thinking Ahead

The process of determining what the key steps of solving a problem will be and what subroutines, variables, classes will be needed for the program.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Breaking down a large problem into a set of smaller problems which can be solved easier.

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
