# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

The software to run and develop programs need certain hardware components and software to run efficiently or at all. These are called the development requirements and they are usually a recommended or minimum guideline.

The game I am creating will run on web javascript meaning a suitable browser is required to run the game efficiently.

| Software  | Hardware Required                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Package 1 | <ul><li>Proc</li><li>RAM</li><li>Disk Space</li></ul> |
