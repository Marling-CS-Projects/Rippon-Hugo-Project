Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of actively online gamers across the internet has increased greatly. The first figure is the distribution of times when gamers are playing before the pandemic. The second figure shows the distribution of the same people after the pandemic. (Barr, 2021) This shows a clear shift towards an increased playtime across individuals, indicating that during this time of stress people resort to video games to spend their time, where they can connect with others online. There is also studies to show that online multiplayer games have a beneficial effect in diminishing anxiety and stress among young adults and college students in the UK, US, and Italy.

The challenge of creating an online multiplayer game is something which I can benefit from, as I must learn how to use TCP packets in javascript and I will also learn how to use the kaboom.js platform for creating 2D games. TCP networking will be used to allow the clients to communicate on the backend&#x20;
