Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of actively online gamers across the internet has increased greatly. The first figure is the distribution of times when gamers are playing before the pandemic. The second figure shows the distribution of the same people after the pandemic. (Barr, 2021) This shows a clear shift towards an increased playtime across individuals, indicating that during this time of stress people resort to video games to spend their time, where they can connect with others online. There is also studies to show that online multiplayer games have a beneficial effect in diminishing anxiety and stress among young adults and college students in the UK, US, and Italy.

In 2018, a government census showed that 92% of all US households had at least one type of computer, and 85% had an internet subscription.(Bureau, 2021) Similarly, in the UK it was found that 96% of households had internet access as of 2020.(Prescott, 2020) This means that an online multiplayer game with little hardware requirements is accessible by a very large amount of people.
