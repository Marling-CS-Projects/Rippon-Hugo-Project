# 2.2.2 Cycle 2 Rotation

## Design

For this cycle I want to have the player able to rotate their character, which will serve as the base for the tank game for aiming. This will be controlled with the left and right arrows on the keyboard. Holding "alt" while controlling the character will slow the speed of the rotation so that players can aim more precisely.&#x20;
