# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 Terrain

## Design

The aim of this cycle is to get a working terrain generation which has a simple sine wave for collision.

### Objectives

* [x] Render a single-coloured terrain on the screen
* [x] Add collision to the terrain so bullets can't fall through
* [x] Make sure players/characters can't spawn below the terrain

### Key functions

| Scene Name      | Use                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| generateTerrain | Renders a drawing of the terrain which will be randomized in a later cycle but is a sine wave for now |
| tCollision      | Spawns in objects to add collision to the terrain as drawings don't have collision                    |

### Pseudocode

```
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is a sine wave terrain with collision coloured red and players now spawn on top of the terrain.

```javascript
```

### Challenges

The only challenges I encountered during this cycle were getting the scenes to transition without problems which was worked out quite quickly.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                  | What I expect                                                                          | What actually happens                            | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                                      | Kaboom should run and take you to the main menu                                        | Kaboom ran normally and took me to the main menu | Pass      |
| 2    | Hover over one of the buttons with the cursor | Button should enlarge                                                                  | Button enlarged                                  | Pass      |
| 3    | Click one of the buttons                      | Button should function as expected                                                     | Button functions as expected                     | Pass      |
| 4    | Go to the practice range                      | Message should appear telling you how to exit back to the menu                         | Message appeared                                 | Pass      |
| 5    | Shoot at the target                           | After hitting the target, player position should change and a new target should appear | Target reappeared and player moved               | Pass      |
| 6    | Press "esc" while in practice                 | Player should be taken back to the main menu                                           | Player returns to main menu                      | Pass      |
