# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | The game objective is clear to the player and menus are simple to navigate. However, the controls aren't obvious to new players so adding a "game controls" menu would have been beneficial.                                                                                       |
| 2 - Efficient      | The game uses hardware resources effectively to get a sufficient performance without any input delay or frame drops.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | The game is fun to play with 2 people and keeps the players engaged with its competitive nature.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | The game doesn't crash and operates smoothly. No errors have been encountered during playtesting so far.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The game has an easy learning curve when using practice mode after learning the controls as the player is able to test using different power levels and angles depending on different situations. The controls take some learning as they aren't told to the player explicitly.    |
