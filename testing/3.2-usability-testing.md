# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | The game objective is clear to the player and menus are simple to navigate. However, the controls aren't obvious to new players so adding a "game controls" menu would have been beneficial.                                                                                       |
| 2 - Efficient      | The game uses hardware resources effectively to get a sufficient performance without any input delay or frame drops.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | The game is fun to play with 2 people and keeps the players engaged with its competitive nature.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | The game doesn't crash and operates smoothly. No errors have been encountered during playtesting so far.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | The game has an easy learning curve when using practice mode after learning the controls as the player is able to test using different power levels and angles depending on different situations. The controls take some learning as they aren't told to the player explicitly.    |

### User Feedback

A google form which has questions based on the game was used to get feedback and understand how others felt about it.&#x20;

All players agreed that the game runs smoothly with little or no frame drops. 87.5% said that the game ran perfectly and 12.5% said that it ran mostly smoothly.

75% said the game was fun and 25% said it was very fun.

62.5% said the game was the right difficulty with 37.5% finding it quite easy.

Improvements suggested by people include:

* Adding a screen that shows the controls
* Improving textures and sprites to make the game more immersive
* A conformation screen showing when it is the next player's turn
* A record of previous multiplayer games&#x20;

There are a couple bugs / issues in the game which haven't been fixed. Very rarely generated levels are impossible to complete, and the players' barrels can go through the ground allowing them to shoot under the level.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The colour palette chosen has a high contrast between the elements making them stand out more.  |
| 2         | Game should be challenging but not too difficult                                                |
| 3         | Easy to navigate menus                                                                          |

### Criterion 1

The colours of my game all have a contrast from each other. The background, terrain, bullets and players are easily distinguishable in the game.

### Criterion 2

The game is very challenging and multiplayer games often take a few tries before anyone gets hit, but practicing in the practice mode makes it much easier, however still challenging so I feel that the difficulty of my game is fine.

### Criterion 3

The menus in the game are self explanatory and easy to navigate without needing any explanation.
