# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Accessibility -** The game is made in Replit which runs on browsers and requires an internet connection to be able to run the game. Also, the game is only able to be played on a PC or laptop. There is currently no implementation for controller support in my game yet meaning it can only be played with a computer keyboard and a mouse / trackpad.&#x20;
* **Graphics -** Due to time limitations, the sprites and textures for my game are all very simple.&#x20;
